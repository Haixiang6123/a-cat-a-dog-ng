## How to use

### Before running it
Before running it, you need to add a file `secret.ts` to 
the directory `/src/app/http`. So, it would be `/src/app/http/secret.ts`.

Then place following codes in it.

```typescript
export const catKey = 'APPLY THE KEY ON https://thecatapi.com/'
export const dogKey = 'APPLY THE KEY ON https://thedogapi.com/'
```

For those 2 keys, you need to sign up in [thecatapi.com](https://thecatapi.com/) and [thedogapi.com](https://thedogapi.com/).

### Now run it

Now, enter following commands to run it :)
```bash
$ cd a-cat-a-dog-ng

$ yarn install

$ ng serve
```
